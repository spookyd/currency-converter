# `routes` Directory

The purpose of the routes directory is to contain the screens/ scenes. We will define a screen in this directory with the exception of the container file which will be responsable for 
fetching and manages the data for the route/screen/scene.
  

Use the following structure

```
.
|--- Home
|    |--- Home.js
|    |--- HomeContainer.js
|    |--- index.js
|    |--- styles.js
|--- SomeScene
|    |--- SomeScene.js
|    |--- SomeSceneContainer.js
|    |--- index.js
|    |--- styles.js
